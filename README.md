# OWASP_Risk_Calculator

The OWASP Risk Calculator is a tool designed to assess and compute the overall risk associated with security vulnerabilities based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) risk methodology.

## Description

This project provides a user interface to calculate the risk associated with various security vulnerabilities based on OWASP's risk factors. Users can input threat agent factors, vulnerability factors, technical impact, and business impact to derive an overall risk score.

## Features

- **Threat Agent Factors:** Input fields for factors such as skill level, motive, opportunity, and size.
- **Vulnerability Factors:** Allows selection of ease of discovery, exploit, awareness, and intrusion detection.
- **Technical Impact Factors:** User input for loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability.
- **Business Impact Factors:** Selections for financial damage, reputation damage, non-compliance, and privacy violation.
- **Chart Representation:** Visual representation of the calculated scores with a bar chart.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Input values in the respective categories.
3. Click the appropriate fields and observe the Likelihood and Impact scores change.
4. The overall risk score is displayed along with color-coded indicators.
5. The bar chart visually represents the calculated scores for different risk factors.

## Setup

No special setup is required. Simply open the HTML file in a compatible web browser to utilize the OWASP Risk Calculator.
